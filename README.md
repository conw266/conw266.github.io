Interested in my hobbies?

Music: I'm an avid fan of music, although not the music most would think of when the word "music" is brought up. I enjoy video game background music from all sorts of gaming franchises. While I grew up with the advancement of technology, once music was able to be accessed on the go, I would gradually continue to listen via teh latest technology. I first started listening to music via the original Ipod, and once I obtained a phone, I would listen via the apple wired earbuds. Now and days we have the apple Airpods, which utilize bluetooth technology. Fun fact: Apple is expected to release the latest version of Airpod Pros towards fall 2024.

Gaming: Gaming has been a large part of my life. From playing games on old flash websites on the computer, to games on the early version of the Iphone, this was another example of technology that as time passed, I watched it evolve and advance. I started console gaming on the Wii, and later got an X-box 360. As of today, I now have a playstation 5, which I predominatly use, leaving my PC for educational use.

Art: Every so often I get a huge burst of creativity and draw, or digitally make art. In highschool I took many digital design classes. If not for my interest leaning to engineering and technology, I would have likely went into digial design. Unfortunately, creative block is a thing, and occasionally it can show up.
